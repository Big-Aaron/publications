# Free Real Estate

The goal of the challenge is to collect as many tokens as possible.
There were a bunch of unclaimed airdrops (for contracts) that could be triggered by anyone. And these contracts are mostly peripherals for DEXs (router, zapper, ...). Since they're not designed to hold tokens, it's not that hard to steal challenge tokens from them. (Except in cases where we have to fake the airdrop as a trade output and then also handle the DEX LP stuff).
